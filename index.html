            There are 25 questions that you must answer. They contain
            mathematical expressions of varying difficulty, starting from
            addition and subtraction to multiplication and division.
          </li>
          <li>
            You have 10 seconds to answer each question. When the time runs out,
            the correct answer will be revealed without an addition to your
            score. Think fast and act fast!
          </li>
          <li>
            Correct answers are worth 4 points. Incorrect answers or blank
            answers (due to running out of time) won't deduct score.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you have answered all questions, you'll be graded based on the
            amount of correct answers you got. There'll also be a timer that
            tracks how much time you've spent overall and the average of your
            time spent on each question.
          </li>
